    <div class="about-paragraph">
    <p class="about1">We are a family owned business who got their start in candles after one of our children wanted a candle making kit for Christmas. We saw how much fun they were having with their kit and we thought we’d give it a try with more professional equipment. After a few batches, we kept finding ourselves making delicious scents and wanted our friends and extended family to experience this joy as well. We sent off some samples and began to hear so much praise for these unique scents. This is where it all began.</p>

        <p class="about2">Thanks to you, our customers, for the loyal support and praise we are here today and growing each year. We cannot thank you enough for what this business has become. We are now based in Ohio and have expanded warehouses twice now. We are still family owned after 7 years of business and pride ourselves on that.</p>


        <p class="about3">We take suggestions from our customers every quarter on what scents they’d like us to keep and what potential new ones they’d like to smell. We always want our customers to be involved in the choices we make as we are a business that caters to you. We have recently come out with a personalized subscription option for our customers that allows them to get their candles on a regular basis and at a discounted rate.

        <p class="about4">Thank you for your continued support and we cannot wait to make your house smell like a home.</p>
